While a 404 error is disappointing for website visitors who cannot find the desired content, it does not always mean that the information is unavailable. There are often solutions to fix the error and quickly redirect visitors to the intended webpage. Here are some potential solutions to achieve a 404 error fix

1 Reload the page

-   Click the ‘Refresh’ button in your browser or press F5
-   Example: https://example.com/missing-page

2 Solution: Refresh the page and check if it loads properly

-   Check the URL
-   Verify the specified path of the website
-   Look for spelling mistakes, misplaced or missing forward slashes
-   Example: https://example.com/misisng-page
-   Solution: Correct the typo in the URL and try accessing the page again

3 Go back through the directory levels

-   Remove the last directory in the URL and go back to the previous directory level
-   Example: https://example.com/missing-page
-   Solution: Remove “missing-page” and access https://example.com to check if the desired page is linked there

4 Use a search engine

-   Use a search engine to search for the desired page
-   Example: https://www.google.com/search?q=example+missing+page
-   Solution: Enter “example missing page” in the search engine and look for relevant results

5 Delete the browser cache and cookies

-   Clear the browser cache and all cookies for the website
-   Example: Clear cache and cookies for Chrome
-   Solution: Access the browser settings, select “Clear browsing data” and choose the cache and cookies option for the specific website
